## 12.2.4 Exercises
#1. How does dplyr::near() work? Type near to see the source code. Is sqrt(2)^2 near 2?

dplyr::near
# The near() function compares two numbers with a small tolerance to handle floating-point inaccuracies.

sqrt(2)^2 == 2
near(sqrt(2)^2, 2)
# Yes, sqrt(2)^2 is near(2).

#2. Use mutate(), is.na(), and count() together to describe how the missing values in dep_time, sched_dep_time and dep_delay are connected.

#First, let us try to compute the number of rows where, as it should be, `sched_dep_time - dep_time == dep_delay`. As we see below, the results is `NA` since `NAs` are contagious in addition, the result returns `NA` .

flights |>
  select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay) |>
  mutate(check1 = sched_dep_time - dep_time == dep_delay) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    equal = sum(check1)
  )


# Now, let us rework the maths with using `is.na()` to remove missing values of departure time, i.e. cancelled flights. We can use `filter(!is.na(dep_time))` . The results indicate that 69.% of flights, the departure delay is equal to difference between departure time and scheduled departure time.

flights |>
  select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay) |>
  filter(!is.na(dep_time)) |>
  mutate(check1 = dep_time - sched_dep_time == dep_delay) |>
  summarise(
    total = n(),
    equal = sum(check1)
  ) |>
  mutate(perc_equal = (equal*100)/total)

# Now, onto checking the relation between missing values. We observe that none of the Scheduled Departure Time values are missing. There are 8,255 missing Departure Time values, which indicate a cancelled flight. There are also 8,255 missing Departure Delay values, and we show below that these are the exact same flights for which the departure time is missing. Thus, the missing values in `dep_delay` and `dep_time` are connected and exaclty occurring for same rows.

# Number of row with missing Scheduled Departure Time
flights |>
  filter(is.na(sched_dep_time)) |>
  count() |>
  as.numeric()

# The number of rows with missing Departure Time
flights |>
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) |>
  count() |>
  as.numeric()

# The number of rows with missing Departure Delay
flights |>
  filter(is.na(dep_delay)) |>
  count() |>
  as.numeric()

# Checking whether the exact same rows have missing values
# for Departure Time and Departure Delay
sum(which(is.na(flights$dep_time)) != which(is.na(flights$dep_delay)))

## 12.4.4 Exercises
#1. What will sum(is.na(x)) tell you? How about mean(is.na(x))?
# The expression `sum(is.na(x))` tells us the number of missing values in the vector `x`. The expression `mean(is.na(x))` tells us the proportion of missing values in the vector `x` . 

#2. What does prod() return when applied to a logical vector? What logical summary function is it equivalent to? What does min() return when applied to a logical vector? What logical summary function is it equivalent to? Read the documentation and perform a few experiments.

# A logical vector with random TRUE and FALSE
random <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE),
            size = 10,
            replace = TRUE)
random

# A logical vector with all TRUE
all_true <- rep(TRUE, 10)
all_true

# A logical vector with all FALSE
all_false <- rep(FALSE, 10)
all_false

prod(random)
prod(all_true)
prod(all_false)

min(random)
min(all_true)
min(all_false)

# In R, when we apply the `prod()` function to a logical vector, it treats `TRUE` as 1 and `FALSE` as 0, and then computes the product of the elements in the vector. Essentially, it multiplies all the elements together. This can be useful when we want to check if all elements in a logical vector are `TRUE`, as the product will be 1 if all are `TRUE` and 0 if any of them is `FALSE`.

# This is equivalent to using the `all()` function, which checks if all elements in a logical vector are `TRUE`. The `all()` function returns `TRUE` if all elements are `TRUE` and `FALSE` otherwise.

# Now, when we apply the `min()` function to a logical vector, it also treats `TRUE` as 1 and `FALSE` as 0, and then computes the minimum value. Since 0 represents `FALSE` and 1 represents `TRUE`, the minimum value in a logical vector is `FALSE` (0). Therefore, when we use `min()` on a logical vector with even one value `FALSE`, it will return `FALSE`.

# In summary, `prod()` and `min()` applied to logical vectors have specific behavior related to the interpretation of `TRUE` and `FALSE`, and they are equivalent to the `all()`.

##12.5.4 Exercises
#1. A number is even if it’s divisible by two, which in R you can find out with x %% 2 == 0. Use this fact and if_else() to determine whether each number between 0 and 20 is even or odd.

x = 0:20
if_else(x %% 2 == 0,
        true = "even",
        false = "odd")

#2. Given a vector of days like x <- c("Monday", "Saturday", "Wednesday"), use an if_else() statement to label them as weekends or weekdays.

days = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
      "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
weeknd = c("Saturday", "Sunday")

x = sample(days, size = 10, replace = TRUE)

cbind(x,
      if_else(x %in% weeknd,
              "Weekends",
              "Weekdays", 
              "NA")) |>
  as_tibble() |> gt()

#3. Use if_else() to compute the absolute value of a numeric vector called x.

x = sample(x = -10:10,
           replace = TRUE,
           size = 100)

tibble(
  x = x,
  abs_x = if_else(x < 0,
                  true = -x,
                  false = x,
                  missing = 0)
) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_interactive(use_pagination = TRUE,
                  pagination_type = "simple")

#4. Write a case_when() statement that uses the month and day columns from flights to label a selection of important US holidays (e.g., New Years Day, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). First create a logical column that is either TRUE or FALSE, and then create a character column that either gives the name of the holiday or is NA.

flights |>
  mutate(holiday = case_when(
    month == 1 & day == 1   ~ "New Year’s Day",
    month == 6 & day == 19  ~ "Juneteenth National Independence Day",
    month == 7 & day == 4   ~ "Independence Day",
    month == 11 & day == 11 ~ "Veterans’ Day",
    month == 12 & day == 25 ~ "Christmas Day",
    .default = NA
  ),
  .keep = "used") |>
  mutate(is_holiday = if_else(!is.na(holiday),
                              true = TRUE,
                              false = FALSE))

## 13.3.1 Exercises
#1. How can you use count() to count the number of rows with a missing value for a given variable?

flights |>
  group_by(month) |>
  summarise(total = n(),
            missing = sum(is.na(dep_time))) |>
  gt()


flights |>
  group_by(month) |>
  count(wt = is.na(dep_time)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  gt()

#2. Expand the following calls to count() to instead use group_by(), summarize(), and arrange():

flights |>
  group_by(dest) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n))


flights |>
  group_by(tailnum) |>
  summarise(n = sum(distance))

## 13.4.8 Exercises

#1. Explain in words what each line of the code used to generate Figure 13.1 does.

# Load in the data-set flights from package nycflights13
flights |> 
# Create a variable hour, which is the quotient of the division of
# sched_dep_time by 100. Further, group the dataset by this newly 
# created variable "hour" to get data into 24 groups - one for each
# hour.
group_by(hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100) |> 

# For each gropu, i.e. all flights scheduled to depart in that
# hour, compute the NAs, i.e. cancelled flights, then compute their
# mean, i.e. proportion of cancelled flights; and also create a 
# variable n, which is the total number of flights
summarize(prop_cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)), n = n()) |> 

# Remove the flights departing between 12 midnight and 1 am, since
# these are very very few, and all are cancelled leading to a highly
# skewed and uninformative graph
filter(hour > 1) |> 

# Start a ggplot call, plotting the hour on the x-axis, and 
# proportion of cancelled flights on the y-axis
ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = prop_cancelled)) +

# Create a line graph,which joins the proportion of cancelled 
# flights for each hour. Also, put in in dark grey colour
geom_line(color = "grey50") + 

# Add points for each hour, whose size varies with the total number
# of flights in that hour
geom_point(aes(size = n))

#2. What trigonometric functions does R provide? Guess some names and look up the documentation. Do they use degrees or radians?

# In R, trigonometric functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` expect angles to be in radians by default. However, we can convert between degrees and radians using the `deg2rad` and `rad2deg` functions. For example, to compute the sine of an angle in degrees, you can use `sin(deg2rad(angle))`.

#3. Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. You can see the basic problem by running the code below: there’s a gap between each hour.

flights |>    
  filter(month == 1, day == 1) |>    
  ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +   
  geom_point()

# Convert them to a more truthful representation of time (either fractional hours or minutes since midnight).

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  flights |>    
    filter(month == 1, day == 1) |>    
    ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +   
    geom_point(size = 0.5) +
    labs(subtitle = "Incorrect scheduled departure time"),

  flights |>
    mutate(
      hour_dep = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
      min_dep  = sched_dep_time %%  100,
      time_dep = hour_dep + (min_dep/60)
    ) |>
    filter(month == 1, day == 1) |>    
    ggplot(aes(x = time_dep, y = dep_delay)) +   
    geom_point(size = 0.5) +
    labs(subtitle = "Improved and accurate scheduled departure time",
         x = "Scheduled Departure Time (in hrs)") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,24,4)),
  
  ncol = 2)

#4. Round dep_time and arr_time to the nearest five minutes.

#4. What does flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number() < 4) do? What does flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number(dep_delay) < 4) do?

    prop_delay = dep_delay / total_delay,

  )

#6. Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the average flight delay for an hour is related to the average delay for the previous hour.

## 13.6.7 Exercises
#1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. When is mean() useful? When is median() useful? When might you want to use something else? Should you use arrival delay or departure delay? Why might you want to use data from planes?

# 1. Mean Delay
# - The average delay across all flights.
# - Useful when delays are symmetrically distributed and there are no extreme outliers.

# 2. Median Delay
# - The middle value of delay when sorted.
# - Useful when data is skewed or contains outliers; gives a better "typical" delay.

# 3. Mode of Delays
# - The most frequently occurring delay time.
# - Useful to understand the most common experience for passengers.

# 4. Percentiles (e.g., 75th percentile)
# - Shows the value below which a certain percentage of delays fall.
# - Useful to understand the delay range for most passengers and identify "normal worst-case" scenarios.

# 5. Standard Deviation or IQR
# - Measures the variability or spread of delay times.
# - Useful when evaluating consistency or reliability of flight times.

# Mean vs. Median

# - Mean is useful when the data is evenly distributed and you're okay with the influence of outliers.
# - Median is better when data is skewed or contains extreme values (e.g., a few very long delays).

# Arrival Delay vs. Departure Delay

# - Arrival delay is generally preferred when assessing passenger experience and schedule impact.
# - It includes all delay factors, including air traffic, weather en route, and connection delays.
# - Departure delay is useful for analyzing airport/ground performance or gate issues.

# Using Plane Data

# - Helps control for aircraft-specific factors like maintenance issues or plane utilization.
# - Useful for tracking repeated delays tied to the same aircraft.
# - Can help assess airline operations, turnaround efficiency, and scheduling patterns.
