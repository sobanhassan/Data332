## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## 28.2.1 Exercises

1\. Create a new Quarto document using File \> New File \> Quarto Document. Read the instructions. Practice running the chunks individually. Then render the document by clicking the appropriate button and then by using the appropriate keyboard short cut. Verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  filter(carat > 2) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price,
                       color = color)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  #scale_y_continuous(trans = "log") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 2)


```

Verifying that the code can be modified and re-run:–

```{diamonds |>}
  filter(carat > 2) |>
  filter (carat < 3) |>
  filter (price > 10000) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price,
                       color = color)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Plot of relation between Carat and Price",
       subtitle = "For different colours of diamonds",
       y = "Price (in $)", x = "Carat") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

2\. Create one new Quarto document for each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. Render each of the three documents. How do the outputs differ? How do the inputs differ? (You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output — RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary.)

The outputs are different in the following ways:

The output text and code are same, but rendering to PDF takes more time than Word. HTML rendering seems to be the fastest.

PDF and MS Word cannot incorporate interactive graphics, while HTML offers interactivity.

The size of the PDF document is the largest, followed by MS Word document, while the HTML uses the least disk space.

## 28.3.1 Exercises

2.Using the visual editor, insert a code chunk using the Insert menu and then the insert anything tool.

```{r}
print("Hello World")
```

3.  Using the visual editor, figure out how to:

a\. Add a footnote.

You can add a foot note by selecting the menu **Insert** –\> **Footnote**; or, by using **Ctrl+Shift+7**. Here is an example[^1].

[^1]: This is a footnote

b\. Add a horizontal rule.

You can add a foot note by selecting the menu **Insert** –\> **Horizontal Rule**. Here is an example:

c\. Add a block quote.

> You can add a block quote by selecting the menu **Format** –\> **Block quote**. Here is how we add a block quote:

4.In the visual editor, go to Insert \> Citation and insert a citation to the paper titled Welcome to the Tidyverse using its DOI (digital object identifier), which is 10.21105/joss.01686. Render the document and observe how the reference shows up in the document. What change do you observe in the YAML of your document?

> At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next.[@wickham2019].

Once we render the document, the citation shows up in the very end of the HTML webpage rendered. It is displayed just above the footnotes. The YAML header of the document, when viewed in the “Source” displays an additional line bibliography: references.bib.

## 28.4.1 Exercises

1\. Practice what you’ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.

3\. Copy and paste the contents of diamond-sizes.qmd from <https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto> in to a local R Quarto document. Check that you can run it, then add text after the frequency polygon that describes its most striking features.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("diamonds")
smaller = diamonds |> 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r}
#| label: plot-smaller-diamonds
#| echo: false

smaller |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
rm(smaller)
```

The frequency polygon tells us that the carat distribution peaks at increments of 0.1, reflecting the fact the measurements of `carat` is done in increments of 0.1. Further, there are fewer diamonds of higher `carat` size.

4\. Create a document in a Google doc or MS Word (or locate a document you have created previously) with some content in it such as headings, hyperlinks, formatted text, etc. Copy the contents of this document and paste it into a Quarto document in the visual editor. Then, switch over to the source editor and inspect the source code.

This is sample MS Word Document. I will copy this document into **Visual Editor** of Quarto, and then see the code entered in the **Source Editor**.

-   **First, here's a list of 4 largest continents:**

    (i) Asia
    (ii) Africa
    (iii) North America
    (iv) South America
    (v) Europe
    (vi) Oceania
    (vii) Antarctica

-   **Second, here's a list of largest oceans**

    1.  Pacific Ocean
    2.  Atlantic Ocean
    3.  Indian Ocean
    4.  Arctic Ocean
    5.  Southern Ocean

The text can be **bold,** *iltalic,* or, it can be [underlined.]{.underline}

I observe that The **Source Editor** automatically inserts the R Markdown code needed to produce the visual output of MS Word. The **Visual Editor** displays the text, just like MS Word. Of course, there are some bugs, especially in bulletined lists and numbered lists with indents. I am unable to create copy the format of sub-lists within bullet points into the **Visual Editor**. So, I manually went to the **Source Editor,** and inserted two `tabs` before each sub-list point. But, for retaining the formatting of **bold,** *italics* or underline, the Visual Editor of Quarto is pretty awesome!

## 28.5.5 Exercises

1\. Add a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, color, and clarity. Assume you’re writing a report for someone who doesn’t know R, and instead of setting echo: false on each chunk, set a global option.

```{r}
nrow(diamonds)
g1 = ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(y = cut)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Cut")
g2 = ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(y = color,
                                      fill = color,
                                      color = color)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Color") +
  theme(legend.position = "null")
g3 = ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(y = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Number of Diamonds", y = "Clarity") +
  theme(legend.position = "null")
library(patchwork)
p = g1 / g2 / g3 + plot_layout(ncol = 1)
print(p)
```

2\. Download diamond-sizes.qmd from <https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto.> Add a section that describes the largest 20 diamonds, including a table that displays their most important attributes.

Here's the added section.

Examining the 20 largest diamonds, by `carat` since we know from American Gem Society's [website](https://www.americangemsociety.org/buying-diamonds-with-confidence/4cs-of-diamonds/understanding-diamond-carat-weight-the-4cs-of-diamonds/#:~:text=Carat%20is%20the%20unit%20of,carat%20equals%200.007%20ounce%20avoirdupois. "Understanding Diamond Carat Weight: The 4Cs of Diamonds") that *"Carat is the unit of measurement for the physical weight of diamonds. One carat equals 0.200 grams or 1/5 gram and is subdivided into 100 points."*

```{r}

#| label: Largest-20-diamonds
#| fig-show: hold
#| fig-cap: Comparison of the distribution of cut, color and clarity amongst all diamonds vs. the 20 largest diamonds

top20 = diamonds |>
  arrange(desc(carat)) |>
  top_n(20)

# Examining the cut, color and clarity of the top 20 diamonds, in comparison to all diamonds

g4 = ggplot(data = top20, mapping = aes(y = cut)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Cut")
g5 = ggplot(data = top20, mapping = aes(y = color,
                                      fill = color,
                                      color = color)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Color") +
  theme(legend.position = "null")
g6 = ggplot(data = top20, mapping = aes(y = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "No. of Largest Diamonds", y = "Clarity") +
  theme(legend.position = "null")
library(patchwork)
p1 = g1 / g2 / g3 / g4 / g5 / g6 + plot_layout(ncol = 2, 
                                               nrow = 3,
                                               byrow = FALSE)
print(p1)
```

Hence, we can see that the largest diamonds are, on average, of poorer cut, i.e. `Fair`. They are more likely to be of `l1` `clarity` and `J` and `I` colours.

```{r}
#| label: Remove-Objects
#| echo: false
rm(list = ls())
```

3\. Modify diamonds-sizes.qmd to use label_comma() to produce nicely formatted output. Also include the percentage of diamonds that are larger than 2.5 carats.

```{r}
#| label: Comma-Function-Smaller-Diamonds
smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
comma = function(x) {format(x, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")}
```

Thus, we conclude that we have data about `r comma(nrow(diamonds))` diamonds. Only `r comma(nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller))` are larger than 2.5 carats. The percentage of diamonds that are larger than 2.5 carats is `r comma(100*(nrow(diamonds)-nrow(smaller))/nrow(diamonds))` %. The inline code that I used to get these numbers is:--

```{r}
#| label: 29.5.5-Question-3-Code
#| eval: false
comma(nrow(diamonds))
comma(nrow(diamonds)-nrow(smaller))
comma(100*(nrow(diamonds)-nrow(smaller))/nrow(diamonds))
```

## 28.6.3 Exercises

1\. Open diamond-sizes.qmd in the visual editor, find an image of a diamond, copy it, and paste it into the document. Double click on the image and add a caption. Resize the image and render your document. Observe how the image is saved in your current working directory.

When I render the document, the same image is saved in the `/docs/images` directory of my Quarto Website project. The image name is the same as that of the original file.

2\. Edit the label of the code chunk in diamond-sizes.qmd that generates a plot to start with the prefix fig- and add a caption to the figure with the chunk option fig-cap. Then, edit the text above the code chunk to add a cross-reference to the figure with Insert \> Cross Reference.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
      filter(carat <= 2.5) |>
      ggplot(aes(x = carat)) + 
        geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01) +
        theme_light() +
        labs(x="Diamond Carat Size", y = "Number of Diamonds")
```

3\. Change the size of the figure with the following chunk options, one at a time, render your document, and describe how the figure changes.

a\. fig-width: 10

The option `fig-width:10` keeps the width at a fixed 10 inches

b\. fig-height: 3

The option `fig-height: 3` keeps the height at a fixed 3 inches, and thus disturbs the aspect ratio

c\. out-width: "100%"

The option `out-width:"100%"` keeps the aspect ratio fixed at the default *(approximately 0.618, the golden ratio)*, and makes the plot occupy 100% width of the knitted HTML document.

d\. out-width: "20%"

The option `out-width: "20%"` keeps the aspect ratio fixed at the default *(approximately 0.618, the golden ratio)*, and makes the plot occupy only **20% width** of the knitted HTML document. This makes the plot too small to see.

Overall, after many iterations, I agree that the one of the best options would be `out-width: "70%"` and the `fig-align: center`, as this preserves the aspect ratio, and allows some breathing space on the sides of the plot.
